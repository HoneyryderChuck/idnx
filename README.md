# Idnx

[![CI](https://github.com/HoneyryderChuck/idnx/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HoneyryderChuck/idnx/actions/workflows/test.yml)



`idnx` provides a Ruby API for decoding Internationalized domain names into Punycode.

It provides multi-platform support by using the most approriate strategy based on the target environment:

* It uses (and requires the installation of) [libidn2](https://github.com/libidn/libidn2) in Linux / MacOS;
* It uses [the appropriate winnls APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnls/nf-winnls-idntoascii) in Windows;
* It falls back to a pure ruby Punycode 2003 implementation;

## Installation

If you're on Linux or Mac OS, you'll have to install `libidn2` first:

```
# Mac OS
> brew install libidn2
# Ubuntu, as an example
> apt-get install idn2
```

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'idnx'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install idnx

## Usage

```ruby
require "idnx"

Idnx.to_punycode("bÃ¼cher.de") #=> "xn--bcher-kva.de"
```

## Ruby Support Policy

This library supports at least ruby 2.4 .It also supports both JRuby and Truffleruby.

## Known Issues

### JRuby on MacOS

`idnx` won't work in MacOS when using JRuby 9.2 or lower, due to jruby FFI not having the same path lookup logic than it's counterpart for CRuby, thereby not finding `brew`-installed `libidn2`. This has been fixed since JRuby 9.3 .
